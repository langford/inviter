# tech404 inviter

The application behind the [tech404 automatic invitation system](http://tech404.io)

## Usage

### POST /invitations

To enqueue an invitation request:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"andy@example.com\"}" \
  http://localhost:3000/invitations
```

The route is meant to be used by a JavaScript client. You can whitelist CORS origins in `config/application.rb`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL: `brew install postgresql`
* Redis: `brew install redis`

### Required Configuration

Configuration items are stored in environment variables.

* SLACK_SUBDOMAIN: e.g., tech404 for tech404.slack.com
* SLACK_TOKEN: an API token for an administrator of the organization ([Obtained here](https://api.slack.com/web))
* SIDEKIQ_USERNAME: username for the sidekiq administration area
* SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD: password for the sidekiq administration area

## Deployment

Deployed on Heroku. Ask @alindeman for access. In production, we run a puma process in the same dyno as a sidekiq worker. It's a hack to keep it free.
